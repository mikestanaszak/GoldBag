<a href="https://bukkit.org/threads/economy-gold-purse.491667/">Bukkit Requested Plugin</a>

Did this to practice Java as well as to learn Minecraft/Spigot plugin writing. <br>
Interesting format, very event based and intuitive. <br> 
Creating a development environment and the correct editor was probably the only hard part. <br>

# TODO:
- Add out of the box functionality
   - Add creation of tables in MySQL
   - Add creation of default config/values files in data folder
   - Need to complete some quality improvements as well, however mostly done.
- Could add flatfile functionality, not a fan of it though
